# E-Commerce

This is an E-Commerce platform created using the MEAN stack(MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js). I'm working on this project to keep track of my development skills and new features are added as part of my upskilling journey. 

This web application will enable it's users to buy and sell retail products through the same portal. Each user is appointed a role namely buyer or seller(buyer being the default) and each of these roles have role specific options. For example, buyers can only access the screen to buy products and sellers will have access to both buying page and inventory management page. 

This app is still in it's development phase and has a lot of work to be done.
